# Portfolio Project
A portfolio demonstrates your skills and thought processes to employers, helping you secure part-time or full-time positions. Students with live web applications in their portfolios are highly successful in their career search. Having multiple deployed projects is essential for getting an initial interview at many companies. In this Challenge, you'll apply recently learned skills like flexbox, CSS Grid Layout, media queries, and CSS variables to prepare for future success. You'll practice these skills while creating something valuable for your job search, benefiting you in the long run.

# User Story
To meet the needs of a typical hiring manager, a portfolio should have the following features:

# Acceptance Criteria
The portfolio should include the developer's name, a recent photo, and sections about the developer, their work, and how to contact them.
The portfolio should have navigation links that allow the hiring manager to easily access different sections.
Clicking on a navigation link should take the hiring manager to the corresponding section.
The section showcasing the developer's work should have titled images of their applications.
The first application's image should be larger in size compared to the others.
Clicking on the images of the applications should take the hiring manager to the deployed application.
The portfolio should have a responsive layout that adjusts and looks good on different screen sizes and devices.
By having these features in the portfolio, it will be easier for the hiring manager to review the developer's previous work and make a decision based on their skills and qualifications.
